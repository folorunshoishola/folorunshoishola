I'm Folorunsho Abdulrahman Ishola, a Lagos-based Data/Business Analyst with over two years of experience in analyzing data and building dashboards.

I’ve had the opportunity to collaborate with cross-functional teams, including developers, product managers, and stakeholders, to design intuitive, visually appealing interfaces that enhance user engagement and drive product success.

Throughout my career, I have consistently ensured that my designs directly contribute to user satisfaction and business outcomes. I've made a lot of strategic contributions like Informing business decisions, Identifying new opportunities, Optimizing operation, Data Visualization, Data mining and Data quality improvement. My expertise spans understanding business operations, visual design, time management and prioritization, interaction design, ability to communicate insights to non-technical stake-holders, adaptability and continous learning, effective communication and presentation, and Analysis strategy.

With extensive experience in using Excel, Tablue, Power Bi, SQl, NoSql and a strong passion for creativity and innovation, I strive to push the boundaries in developing products that are not only visually striking but also user-friendly and functional.

In my previous roles, I’ve demonstrated the ability to create elegant and intuitive user experiences that are both aesthetically pleasing and highly functional, grounded in sound design principles.

Looking ahead, I am eager to further hone my skills and leverage new opportunities that align with my goal of meeting potential investors and innovators to develop efficient solutions.

I am available to provide any additional information or to discuss scheduling further inquiries.
